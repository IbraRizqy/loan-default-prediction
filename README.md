## 🏦 Loan Default Prediction

A team project to predict loan defaults using data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset). We tried out four models:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Overall, their performance was quite similar — though Random Forest stood out slightly with an accuracy of around 90%.  
This was one of our first experiences building machine learning models from scratch, and it was a great hands-on intro to working with real financial data.
